# EdD-Stats

I created this repository to organize and share the R code I write as I
complete my EdD. Feel free to use anything you find useful. Most of this
code was written using an AI LLM; sometimes, I was asking it for
guidance and I was writing the code. Other times, I was asking it to
fulfill a goal and allowing it to write the appropriate code to achieve
that goal. Use at your own risk!
